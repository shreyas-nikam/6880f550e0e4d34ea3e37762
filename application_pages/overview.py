    This application simulates the operational risk assessment lifecycle, providing an interactive and educational experience.

    **Purpose and Objectives:**
    The primary purpose of this Streamlit application is to provide an interactive simulation of the operational risk assessment lifecycle within a financial institution, as described in the "PRMIA Operational Risk Manager Handbook". The application aims to educate risk management students, junior risk professionals, and business unit managers by offering a practical, hands-on understanding of how risks are identified, assessed, controlled, and monitored in an iterative process.

    **Key Learning Outcomes:**
    *   Understand the key stages and flow of a robust operational risk assessment program.
    *   Learn how top-down risk identification informs bottom-up control assessment.
    *   Explore the interplay between inherent risk, control effectiveness, and residual risk.
    *   Recognize the importance of clear taxonomies and consistent tracking in risk management.
