In this lab, we will explore the Operational Risk Assessment Lifecycle Simulator. This application provides an interactive simulation of the operational risk assessment lifecycle within a financial institution.

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
*   Understand the key stages and flow of a robust operational risk assessment program.
*   Learn how top-down risk identification informs bottom-up control assessment.
*   Explore the interplay between inherent risk, control effectiveness, and residual risk.
*   Recognize the importance of clear taxonomies and consistent tracking in risk management.
