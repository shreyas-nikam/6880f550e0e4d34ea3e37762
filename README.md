This Streamlit application, **QuLab: Operational Risk Assessment Lifecycle Simulator**, provides an interactive and educational simulation of the operational risk assessment lifecycle within a financial institution. It is designed based on principles described in the "PRMIA Operational Risk Manager Handbook," offering a hands-on approach to understanding key concepts in operational risk management.

## 1. Project Description

The primary purpose of this Streamlit application is to provide an interactive simulation of the operational risk assessment lifecycle. It aims to educate risk management students, junior risk professionals, and business unit managers by offering a practical, hands-on understanding of how risks are identified, assessed, controlled, and monitored in an iterative process within a financial institution.

The application guides users through different aspects of operational risk management, from simulating historical loss events to performing structured risk assessments and visualizing the impact of controls.

## 2. Key Features

*   **Interactive Overview:** Provides a clear introduction to the application's purpose and the core concepts of operational risk assessment.
*   **Loss Data Simulation:**
    *   Generate synthetic operational loss event data based on user-defined parameters (number of events, date range, business units, risk categories).
    *   Preview the generated dataset.
    *   Visualize loss trends over time, relationships between loss amount and recovery time, and total loss by business unit using interactive Plotly charts.
*   **Risk Assessment Module:**
    *   Define and store risk assessment units with their inherent risk levels and associated controls.
    *   Calculate residual risk based on selected inherent risk and control effectiveness levels using a configurable risk matrix (Simple/Weighted approaches).
    *   Visualize the residual risk matrix as a heatmap, illustrating the interplay between inherent risk and control effectiveness.
*   **Intuitive User Interface:** Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use and interactive experience, featuring a sidebar for seamless navigation between modules.

## 3. Learning Outcomes

By interacting with this simulator, users will:

*   Understand the key stages and flow of a robust operational risk assessment program.
*   Learn how top-down risk identification informs bottom-up control assessment.
*   Explore the interplay between inherent risk, control effectiveness, and residual risk.
*   Recognize the importance of clear taxonomies and consistent tracking in risk management.

## 4. Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/QuLab-ORM-Simulator.git
    cd QuLab-ORM-Simulator
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `your-username/QuLab-ORM-Simulator` with the actual repository URL if it's hosted.)*

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project root with the following content:

    ```
    streamlit
    pandas
    numpy
    plotly
    ```

    Then, install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 5. Usage

To run the Streamlit application:

1.  **Navigate to the project root directory** (where `app.py` is located) in your terminal.
2.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated.**
3.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    This command will open the application in your default web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

**How to Use:**

*   **Navigation:** Use the sidebar on the left to navigate between "Overview", "Loss Data Simulation", and "Risk Assessment" pages.
*   **Loss Data Simulation:**
    *   Adjust the number of events, date range, business units, and risk categories.
    *   Click "Generate Loss Data" to create and visualize the synthetic dataset.
*   **Risk Assessment:**
    *   Use the "Define Risk Assessment Units" section to input business unit names, inherent risk, and controls. Click "Store Risk Assessment."
    *   Use the "Calculate Residual Risk" section to select inherent risk, control effectiveness, and a calculation approach to see the resulting residual risk and its heatmap visualization.
